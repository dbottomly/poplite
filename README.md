The `poplite` package
=========

Installation
----------

The newest stable version of the package is available from CRAN

If you wish to use a development version that has not yet been pushed to CRAN the package can also be installed manually by first clicking 'Download ZIP' and unzipping the resulting 
'poplite-master.zip' file into a convenient directory.  From within R in the same directory as 'poplite-master' type:

install.packages("poplite-master", repos=NULL, type="source")

or for instance using the `devtools` package:

install_github(username="dbottomly", repo="poplite", ref="master")

Note that another branch name can be substituted for 'master'
