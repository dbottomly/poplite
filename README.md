=========

Installation
----------

The newest stable version of the package is available from CRAN.

If you wish to use a development version that has not yet been pushed to CRAN the package can also be installed manually by first clicking 'Download ZIP' and unzipping the resulting 
`poplite-master.zip` file into a convenient directory.  From within R in the same directory as `poplite-master` type:

```R
install.packages("poplite-master", repos=NULL, type="source")
```

or for instance using the `devtools` package:

```R
install_github("dbottomly/poplite", ref="master")
```

Note that another branch name can be substituted for `master`
