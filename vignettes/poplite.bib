abstract ={Summary: VariantAnnotation is an R / Bioconductor package for the exploration and annotation of genetic variants. Capabilities exist for reading, writing and filtering variant call format (VCF) files. VariantAnnotation allows ready access to additional R / Bioconductor facilities for advanced statistical analysis, data transformation, visualization and integration with diverse genomic resources.Availability and implementation: This package is implemented in R and available for download at the Bioconductor Web site (http://bioconductor.org/packages/2.13/bioc/html/VariantAnnotation.html). The package contains extensive help pages for individual functions and a ‘vignette’ outlining typical work flows; it is made available under the open source ‘Artistic-2.0’ license. Version 1.9.38 was used in this article.Contact: vobencha@fhcrc.org},
